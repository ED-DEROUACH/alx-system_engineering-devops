# **Postmortem**

*Learning how to write an Incident Report, also referred to as a Postmortem. This postmortem follows the guidelines used closely by Google engineers to file reports. The report is made up of five parts: an issue summary, a timeline, root cause analysis, resolution and recovery, and lastly, corrective and preventative measures. Let's review each of these parts in detail.*
