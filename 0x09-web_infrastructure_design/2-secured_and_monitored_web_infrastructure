Here's what each component represents:

User: This represents the user who wants to access the website.

DNS (8.8.8.8): The DNS server resolves the domain name (www.foobar.com) to the IP address of the Load Balancer.

Load Balancer (HAProxy): The load balancer distributes incoming traffic evenly among the web servers (Nginx) to achieve load balancing and high availability.

Nginx: These are the web servers responsible for serving static files and handling incoming HTTP requests. They also terminate SSL connections.

Application Server: This server runs your application code and handles dynamic content.

MySQL: The database server stores and manages data, such as user accounts and other dynamic information.

Firewalls (x3): These represent the firewalls added for network security. They control incoming and outgoing traffic and protect against threats.

SSL Certificate: This is used to enable HTTPS, ensuring encrypted traffic between users and the web servers.

Monitoring Clients: These clients collect data and logs to monitor the infrastructure's performance and security.

This architecture provides redundancy, security, encryption, and monitoring for a robust web infrastructure. Ensure that you label each component and add arrows to indicate the flow of requests and data.
