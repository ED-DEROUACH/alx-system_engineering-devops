Here's what each component represents:

User: This represents the user who wants to access the website.

DNS (8.8.8.8): The DNS server resolves the domain name (www.foobar.com) to the IP address of the Load Balancer.

Load Balancer (HAProxy): The load balancer distributes incoming traffic evenly among the web servers (Nginx) to achieve load balancing and high availability.

Nginx: These are the web servers responsible for serving static files and handling incoming HTTP requests.

Application Server: This server runs your application code and handles dynamic content.

MySQL: The database server stores and manages data, such as user accounts and other dynamic information.

Ensure that you label each component and add arrows to indicate the flow of requests and data. This architecture provides redundancy and load balancing to improve performance and fault tolerance.
